# Timeline-HN
### What is this?
Timeline-HN is a repository holding the CSS file Historic Northampton uses for their Timelines.

### How can I use it?
Timeline-HN is building upon [Timeline.JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), it holds a CSS file that, when appended onto a timeline URL, it changes the theme to a more legibal color scheme. 

### Example
When you created your [Timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make), simply appending ``&theme=https://emmetsp.github.io/Timeline-HN/timeline.css`` on the end of your URL will change its look!
