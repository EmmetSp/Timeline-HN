Besides economic reasons, a person could be warned out if neighbors complained about their behavior, opening the doors for already marginalized people to be expelled from New England towns. Even people of color who were lawful residents of New England town were unofficially warned out (Hampshire Council of Government Records; Wallis Herndon, Unwelcome Americans: Living on the Margin in Early New England)"
